<h4>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h4>
<h6>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to mimic the problem solving and decision making capabilities of the human mind. It forms the backbone of the technologies we encounter daily, from chat bots to autonomous vehicles and advanced language model like ChatGPT, GROK, Gemini and etc.</h6>

<h6>Key areas of AI includes machine learning (where computers learn from the examples), natural language processing (where helps machines understand and respond back in human language), computer vision (so machines can understand images or videos), robotics(machines that can do tasks on their own).</h6>
<h6>We all have seen the AI in action in real-world ranging from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, to fraud detection in banking, in hospitals to predict the diseases, also suggesting what to watch or buy in the apps like Netflix and Amazon, and helps the developers by suggesting code, fixing errors, and speeding up the development using tools like GitHub Copilot.</h6>


<h4>what is Blockchain?</h4>

<h6>Blockchain is a special kind of digital record system that shared across the network of participants and all have the up to date information at a same time. Every transaction securely stored using cryptographic algorithm, and once it added, it can’t be changed. Blockchain is difficult to manipulate and hack that’s why it is very trustworthy.</h6>

<h6>In real world, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are most popular use case of Blockchain, but it’s used for much more. It’s like a digital notepad that everyone trusts and no one controls alone</h6>
