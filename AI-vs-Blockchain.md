<h4>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h4>
<h6>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to mimic the problem solving and decision making capabilities of the human mind. It forms the backbone of the technologies we encounter daily, from chat bots to autonomous vehicles and advanced language model like ChatGPT, GROK, Gemini and etc.</h6>
<h6>Key areas of AI includes machine learning (where computers learn from the examples), natural language processing (where helps machines understand and respond back in human language), computer vision (so machines can understand images or videos), robotics(machines that can do tasks on their own).</h6>
<h6>We all have seen the AI in action in real-world ranging from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, to fraud detection in banking, in hospitals to predict the diseases, also suggesting what to watch or buy in the apps like Netflix and Amazon, and helps the developers by suggesting code, fixing errors, and speeding up the development using tools like GitHub Copilot.</h6>
